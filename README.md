# ⚡🚗 **Electric Vehicle Data Analysis Dashboard**  

## 📌 **Project Overview**  
The **Electric Vehicle Data Analysis Dashboard** is an interactive **Power BI** visualization that provides insights into **EV adoption trends, manufacturer contributions, model performance, and regional distribution**.  

This project is designed to help **businesses, policymakers, and researchers** make data-driven decisions by analyzing electric vehicle adoption patterns, Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) eligibility, and year-over-year growth trends.  

### 🎯 **Objectives**  
✔ Understand the **total number of electric vehicles (EVs)** and their distribution across different states.  
✔ Compare **Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs)**.  
✔ Identify the **top EV manufacturers and models** based on registrations.  
✔ Examine **yearly trends** in EV adoption.  
✔ Explore **geographical distribution** of EV registrations.  
✔ Assess **CAFV eligibility status** across different EVs.

## 📊 **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**  

### 🚗 **Electric Vehicle Statistics**  
- **Total Registered Vehicles:** 1,50,422  
- **Average Electric Range:** 67.83 miles  
- **Total BEV Vehicles:** 1,16,750 (77.61% of total)  
- **Total PHEV Vehicles:** 33,672 (22.39% of total)  

### 🔍 **Top EV Brands by Registration**  
Tesla leads the market with the highest number of registered EVs, followed by Nissan, Chevrolet, Ford, and BMW. These brands have contributed significantly to the adoption of electric mobility, with Tesla alone accounting for a substantial share of total EV registrations.  

### 📈 **EV Growth Trends**  
Electric vehicle adoption has grown steadily over the years. A sharp increase in registrations was observed between 2017 and 2023, with 2023 seeing the highest number of new registrations. However, a slight dip in 2024 suggests a need for further incentives and infrastructure improvements to sustain adoption rates.  

### 🌍 **State-Wise EV Adoption**  
Certain states, particularly California, Texas, and New York, have seen higher adoption rates due to favorable policies, incentives, and a well-established charging infrastructure. Urban areas tend to have higher adoption rates compared to rural locations.  

### ✅ **CAFV Eligibility Breakdown**  
- **41.81% of vehicles** qualify as Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicles (CAFV), making them eligible for tax credits and incentives.  
- **11.86% of vehicles** are not CAFV eligible, meaning they do not meet the required emission and fuel efficiency standards.  
- **46.33% of vehicles** have unknown eligibility status, suggesting gaps in available data.
